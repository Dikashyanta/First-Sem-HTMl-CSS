                Technological change impacted every profession – but its impact on online sales world
                have been particularly profound. From marketing to creating new products and
                researching the supply and demand, technology have been playing a vital role in selling
                products online. And now, the use of artificial intelligence and intelligent automation
                have been pushing and propelling the sales industry even more forward and making the
                whole process of online business easier, faster and efficient.
                While selling the printers online, technology plays a huge role in providing
                the benefits to both sellers and buyers. It has provided a platform for sellers to promote
                and sell their products. Now, because of technology sellers do not need to open and
                operate an expensive physical store to showcase their products, rather they can store

                their products in a small physical location like a storeroom or some other remote
                location and then promote their products through social media and their own websites to
                the potential buyers. Then social media and search engines makes it easy to find and
                connect with buyers – whether they are in same area or across the world. By doing so,
                a seller can reduce their operation cost of their business by removing a need to operate
                and own a physical store, and buyer can get the product easily and efficiently. Also,
                sellers can store and evaluate the details of their customers which would be helpful in
                promoting and recommending the products to the customers. Other than that, seller can
                research about the quality of the products, price of the products and distributors which
                would help sellers to get a deal which would benefit them the most. Overall, technology
                plays a huge role in selling the printer by making the whole process of
                buying and selling a lot easier, convenient and effictive
